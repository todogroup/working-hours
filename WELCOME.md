# Welcome To Your First TODO Group Work Day
We're glad you're here, and we're excited to get you up and running as a new contributor. Before you jump in, please read this document. Then introduce yourself in the Work Day Zoom!

## What Is A TODO Group Work Day
The Work Days are self-organized working sessions that help us keep TODO Group resources up to date. The TODO Group owns many repos and documents that require ongoing maintenance. Once a month, the TODO Group hosts a Work Day in both AMER and EU-friendly timezones. These Work Days are an opportunity for TODO Group members to make contributions to our shared resources.

## How Do Work Days Work?
Work Days always open with a welcome from the Host, a brief round of introductions, and an overview of the https://github.com/todogroup/work-day-activities repository. Attendees then indicate what they are intending to work on, and the Host helps newcomers find opportinities to make contributions or pair up with Work Day veterans. Typically, the Work Day Zoom is kept open for questions. Pairs or groups that want to have robust discussions typically break off into separate discussion channels. Work Days are scheduled for two hours, and people may come and go during the working session as their schedules permit.

## What Should I Do First
* Review the [Readme](./README.md)
* Introduce yourself to the Work Day Zoom (Name, Company, One-Two Senteces About You)
* Ask the Host for assistance if aren't sure where to contribute

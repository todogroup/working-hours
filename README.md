## What is a Work Day?

Work Days are primarily for doing cleanup on the various issues and PRs in the [TODO Group GitHub organisation](https://github.com/todogroup). We've found that if we don't regularly set aside time to do these tasks, they never get done.

Here is a list of things that we expect people to work during the WDA meetings. The list is sorted by TODO project contribution level, in descending order:

### *"I'm new" tasks*

* 📩 Add [OSPONews content for next month](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/newsletter#how-to-contribute-to-osponews)
* 🧑‍💻 Capture [new OSPO Job Descriptions](https://landscape.todogroup.org/guide#ospo-career-path)
* 📌 Add [new tech & open source conferences](https://github.com/todogroup/presentations/blob/main/2022-tech-events.md) to the 2022 list
* 🔭 Add new tools for [Awesome OSS Management tooling list](https://github.com/todogroup/awesome-ospo#awesome-oss-management-)

### *"I'm in a working group" tasks*

* 📝 Work on [WIP 2022 TODO Guides](https://github.com/todogroup/todogroup.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aguide)
* 📘 Work on [WIP 2022 Whitepapers](https://github.com/todogroup/outbound-oss)

* 📊 Share [feedback to OSPO 2022 Survey](https://github.com/todogroup/osposurvey/tree/master/2022#welcome-to-ospo-survey-2022-planning)
* 📖 Work on [General OSPO Guide](https://landscape.todogroup.org/guide) structure
* 🧩 [Update old](https://landscape.todogroup.org/guide#ospos-in-practice) or [create new OSPO Case Studies](https://github.com/todogroup/todogroup.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22use+case%22)

### *"I have long term experience with TODO repo and GH project" tasks*
* ⚙️ Clean up access to repos
* ✅ Resolve outstanding pull requests from the following repos: `ospo-landscape` `todogroup.org` `ospology` `repo linter`
* ✍️ Fix README files (like this one!)

## Schedule and meetings

Work days occur once a month and scheduled for two hours.

**WORK DAYS ARE SCHEDULED FOR:** 

| 🌏 Meeting | 💬 Facilitator | 🕙 Day & time | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| AMER | Duane | [Second Wednesday of the month at 16:30 PM UTC](https://zoom.us/j/96680666202?pwd=UVNJdVhHS1JiSVRtZFBDTjBVTEFQUT09) |

## Calendar invites

Calendar invites are sent via TODO Mailing list ([Community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU0YGM_IJ6gY8E5IIiwXKD_FZi3kAVc4E9_-3dtTDyKMSjdA/viewform) and General Member) and notified at [TODO Slack general channel](https://slack.todogroup.org/).

Also, we provide an ICS calendar file  for both, AMER and EMEA & APAC, to easily import the meeting series in any agenda at todogroup.org/community.


## Process

1) Read this README documentation
2) Go to [2022 WDA List](https://github.com/todogroup/work-day-activities/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A2022)
3) Choose the section you wish to work on today (guides, ospology, whitepapers, etc)
4) Go to the dedicated repo and check the open issues available

Typically people will send event reminders via Slack and email in advance of the event, so you can start thinking of what you'd like to work on.

On the work day itself, we all gather in the Zoom meeting and touch base, sharing what we plan to work on and asking anyone whether they'd like some help with their chosen tasks. We hang out on the Zoom (creating breakout rooms if needed), typing away on our tasks, asking questions, and generally hanging out productively.

## Join us!

Work days are a great way to see and make friends in TODO Group while also contributing to the community. It's very casual but also productive. Come be a part of the fun!

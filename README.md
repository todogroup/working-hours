# Work Day Activity Tracker

This repo is for tracking activities that we work on during TODO Group Work Days.

## What's a Work Day?

Work Days are primarily for doing cleanup on the various repositories in the [TODO Group GitHub organisation](https://github.com/todogroup). We've found that if we don't regularly set aside time to do these tasks, they never get done.

Things we've worked on include but are not limited to…

* Cleaning up access to repos
* Resolving outstanding pull requests
* Fixing README files (like this one!)

## Timing

"Regularly?" you ask? "Yes!" I answer. 

Currently the work days occur once a quarter. They're typically scheduled for an hour.

**THE NEXT WORK DAY IS SCHEDULED FOR:** Wednesday, November 17, 2021 at 8:30 AM PST

## Calendar invite

If you'd like to be on the invite for the next event, please ping Ana Jimenez (TODO PM) on the TODO Group Slack. She'll make sure you receive the reminder.

## Process

Have you noticed something that you think could use some work? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/todogroup/work-day-activities/issues/new/choose). No, opening an issue doesn't mean you're offering to do the work. ;-)

Typically people will send event reminders via Slack and email in advance of the event, so you can start thinking of what you'd like to work on.

On the work day itself, we all gather in the Zoom meeting and touch base, sharing what we plan to work on and asking anyone whether they'd like some help with their chosen tasks. We hang out on the Zoom (creating breakout rooms if needed), typing away on our tasks, asking questions, and generally hanging out productively.

## Join us!

Work days are a great way to see and make friends in TODO Group while also contributing to the community. It's very casual but also productive. Come be a part of the fun!
